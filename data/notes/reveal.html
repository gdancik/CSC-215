<h1> Using Advanced Cascading Style Sheets </h1> 
<p> Use an embedded style sheet to display a page similar to this one in your browser </p>
<p> This paragraph contains a <a href = "http://www.google.com"> link to Google's homepage. </a> Do you remember how to change the hover pseudoclass so that the link background becomes purple and the link text becomes white when a user hovers over it? If so, do it! <p>

<hr>
<p> This paragraph uses a span tag with the classname 'reveal' (defined in the embedded style sheet) to  <span class = "reveal"> change the style of the last part of the paragraph. </span> </p>
